# MigrantMicroCredit (MMC)

A decentralized micro-credit platform on the Stacks blockchain, empowering migrant entrepreneurs with transparent, borderless access to small loans. Built with Clarity smart contracts, it leverages Web3 for trustless lending, community governance, and tokenized incentives.

## Overview
MigrantMicroCredit (MMC) is a Web3 protocol that facilitates micro-loans (e.g., $50–$500 USD equivalent in STX or sBTC) for migrant startups. It addresses barriers like lack of credit history, high fees from traditional fintech, and geographic restrictions by using blockchain for verifiable identities, automated credit scoring, and peer-to-peer lending pools.

Key Features:
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Migrants register with proof-of-residency or startup plans without needing bank accounts.
- **AI-Integrated Credit Scoring**: Off-chain oracles feed data for on-chain scoring.
- **Tokenized Incentives**: Lenders earn MMC tokens for providing liquidity; borrowers gain reputation NFTs for timely repayments.
- **Governance DAO**: Community votes on loan approvals and risk parameters.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Integrates with Bitcoin via Stacks for secure, low-fee transactions.

The protocol uses 6 core Clarity smart contracts to ensure security, transparency, and composability.

## Real-World Problems Solved
Migrants often face:
- **Credit Exclusion**: 1.7 billion unbanked globally (World Bank, 2023); migrants lack local credit histories.
- **Predatory Lending**: High-interest informal loans (up to 100% APR) exploit vulnerable groups.
- **Border Friction**: Remittances and funding transfers incur 6–7% fees (IFAD, 2024).
- **Verification Gaps**: Proving startup viability without documents.

MMC solves these by:
- Providing collateral-free micro-loans based on social proof and on-chain activity.
- Automating fair interest rates (3–12% APR) via smart contracts.
- Enabling instant, fee-minimal disbursements on Stacks (powered by Bitcoin).
- Building verifiable on-chain reputations for future funding.

Impact Potential: Could unlock $10B+ in annual micro-finance for 50M+ migrant entrepreneurs (UN Migration Report, 2024).

## How It Works
1. **Registration**: Migrants deploy a DID via the `MigrantRegistry` contract, uploading hashed proofs (e.g., visa, business plan IPFS hash).
2. **Credit Assessment**: `CreditScorer` contract queries oracles for scores based on on-chain activity, social signals, and startup metrics.
3. **Loan Request**: Borrowers submit requests to `LoanManager`; community/DAO approves via `Governance`.
4. **Funding & Disbursement**: Approved loans pull from `LiquidityPool`; funds transfer to borrower's wallet.
5. **Repayment & Incentives**: `RepaymentHandler` tracks installments; successful repayments mint reputation NFTs and distribute yields to lenders.
6. **Staking for Lenders**: `LenderVault` allows staking STX/sBTC for yields, with slashing for bad loans.

Architecture Diagram (conceptual):
```
Borrower (Migrant Startup) --> MigrantRegistry --> CreditScorer
                                      |
                                      v
LoanManager <--> Governance <--> LiquidityPool <--> LenderVault
                                      |
                                      v
RepaymentHandler (with Oracle feeds)
```

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Clarity smart contracts).
- **Frontend**: React + Hiro Wallet integration (for user interactions).
- **Oracles**: Gaia storage for off-chain data; Chainlink/Stacks-compatible for credit feeds.
- **Tokens**: SIP-10 fungible token (MMC) for governance/yields; SIP-9 NFTs for reputations.
- **Storage**: IPFS for documents; Stacks' built-in maps for on-chain state.
- **Testing**: Clarinet for local devnet.
- **Deployment**: Hiro's Stacks CLI.

## Smart Contracts
The protocol consists of 6 interlinked Clarity contracts (all in `/contracts/` directory). Each is secure, auditable, and follows Stacks best practices (e.g., no reentrancy, principal-based access control).

### 1. MigrantRegistry.clar
Handles user onboarding and DID management.

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORIZED (err u1000))
(define-constant ERR_ALREADY_REGISTERED (err u1001))

(define-data-var admin principal tx-sender)

(define-map migrants 
    principal 
    { 
        id: uint, 
        startup-hash: (string-ascii 64), 
        verified: bool 
    }
)

(define-public (register-migrant (startup-hash (string-ascii 64)))
    (let (
        (caller tx-sender)
    )
        (asserts! (not (map-get? migrants caller)) ERR_ALREADY_REGISTERED)
        (map-insert migrants caller 
            { 
                id: (var-get next-id), 
                startup-hash: startup-hash, 
                verified: false 
            }
        )
        (var-set next-id (+ (var-get next-id) u1))
        (ok true)

        (map-set migrants migrant 
            (merge current { verified: verified })
        )
        (ok true)

    (map-get? loans loan-id)
)
```

### 4. LiquidityPool.clar
Manages lender funds and yields.

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_LOW_BALANCE (err u4000))

(define-fungible-token pool-token u1000000)  ;; LP tokens

(define-map pool-state 
    principal

    ;; Mint reputation NFT cross-call
    (try! (contract-call? .reputation-nft mint (get borrower (unwrap! (contract-call? .loan-manager get-loan loan-id) ERR_UNAUTHORIZED))))
)
```

### 6. Governance.clar
DAO for approvals and parameter updates.

```clarity
(define-constant ERR_NOT_MEMBER (err u6000))
(define-constant VOTE_THRESHOLD u51)  ;; 51% majority

(define-map members principal bool)
(define-map proposals 
    uint

        description: (string-ascii 256), 
        yes-votes: uint, 
        no-votes: uint, 
        executed: bool 
    }
)

(define-data-var proposal-count uint u0)

(define-public (add-member (new-member principal))
    (asserts! (is-admin tx-sender) ERR_NOT_MEMBER)
    (map-insert members new-member true)
    (ok true)
)

(define-public (vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote bool))
    (asserts! (map-get? members tx-sender) ERR_NOT_MEMBER)
    (let (

            (map-set proposals proposal-id 
                (merge prop { yes-votes: (+ (get yes-votes prop) u1) })
            )
            (map-set proposals proposal-id 
                (merge prop { no-votes: (+ (get no-votes prop) u1) })
            )
        )
        (ok true)
    )
)

(define-public (execute-proposal (proposal-id uint))
    (let (
        (prop (unwrap! (map-get? proposals proposal-id) ERR_NOT_MEMBER))
        (total-votes (+ (get yes-votes prop) (get no-votes prop)))
        (yes-pct (* (get yes-votes prop) u100 / total-votes))
    )
        (asserts! (and (>= yes-pct VOTE_THRESHOLD) (not (get executed prop))) ERR_NOT_MEMBER)
        (map-set proposals proposal-id (merge prop { executed: true }))
        ;; Execute action, e.g., update min-score in LoanManager
        (try! (contract-call? .loan-manager update-min-score u700))  ;; Example
        (ok true)
    )
)

(define-read-only (get-proposal (id uint))
    (map-get? proposals id)
)
```

**Note**: These contracts reference each other via `contract-call?`. In a full repo, implement traits for better composability. Reputation NFTs would be a 7th optional SIP-9 contract, but kept to 6 for core functionality.

## Deployment
1. Install Clarinet: `cargo install clarinet`.
2. Clone repo: `git clone <repo> && cd migrantmicrocredit`.
3. Local Test: `clarinet integrate`.
4. Deploy to Testnet: `clarinet contract deploy --network testnet`.
5. Frontend: `npm install && npm start` (assumes React setup in `/frontend/`).

For mainnet, use Hiro's deploy tools. Audit recommended before production.
